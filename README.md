# Online-Voting-System

Online Voting System
This repository contains an Online Voting System implemented in C++ using JSON for data storage. The system allows users to vote for candidates in an election conducted online.

Overview
The Online Voting System provides the following features:

User registration and login: Users can create an account and log in to the system.
Candidate information: Candidates and their details are stored in the system.
Election management: Administrators can create and manage elections.
Voting process: Registered users can cast their votes for candidates.
Result calculation: The system calculates and displays the election results.
Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

C++ Compiler: Install a C++ compiler compatible with your operating system.
JSON Library: Install a JSON library for C++. You can use libraries like jsoncpp or nlohmann/json.
Setup and Installation
To set up and run the Online Voting System, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary libraries or dependencies required for JSON parsing.
Compile the C++ code using the appropriate compiler commands for your system.
Run the compiled binary file to start the application.
Usage
Once the application is running, you can use the Online Voting System for the following actions:

User Registration:

Users can create an account by providing their details and creating a username and password.
The system stores the user information securely.
User Login:

Registered users can log in to the system using their username and password.
Candidate Information:

Administrators can add candidates to the system.
Each candidate has a unique ID, name, and other relevant details.
Election Management:

Administrators can create and manage elections.
They can set the start and end dates for an election and define the list of candidates participating.
Voting Process:

Registered users can cast their votes for the candidates in the active election.
Users can only vote once and cannot change their vote after submission.
Result Calculation:

After the election ends, the system calculates and displays the results.
The system determines the winner based on the votes received by each candidate.
Security Considerations
When deploying the Online Voting System, consider the following security measures:

Secure user credentials: Store user passwords securely, preferably using hashing algorithms.
Protect the database: Ensure that the JSON data file is securely stored and accessed only by authorized users.
Prevent unauthorized access: Implement authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to administrative features.
Input validation: Validate user input to prevent common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or malicious data entry.
